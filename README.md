For the second Portfolio Project with Code Institute, I have created an online Quiz game about Scandinavia.
The questions are about Scandinavia and the culture of the Scandinavian countries.

## Who is the website for?
	
The quiz is for anybody that wants to play a quiz game, but it can also serve an educational purpose for anyone looking to learn a bit more about Scandinavia, or someone who is just a little curious about the Scandinavian countries

## What does it do?

The quiz displays a question and lets the player choose from 4 different answers. If the player is correct the answer box will light up in green, if the answer is wrong the answer will light up in red and the right answer can be viewed. The player then can go to the next question. If the user tries to go to the next question without choosing an answer, an error message will display, letting them know they need to choose an answer first.

### Validators

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS validator Services have been used to validate each page of the website to ensure no errors in the code.

The Markup Validator did however find one error in the index.html, it was a stray div closing tag. I removed it and the code then passed without any more errors.

The CSS passed without any errors on the first attempt.

### Local testing

### Responsiveness
